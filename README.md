## Introduction
The **Book Recommendation System Using Collaborative-Based Filtering** is a system designed to recommend books to users based on their past interactions and preferences. Utilizing collaborative filtering techniques, it predicts and suggests books that users are likely to enjoy by identifying patterns in user behavior and preferences.

## Features
- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends books by finding users with similar tastes.
- **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests books similar to those a user has liked in the past.
- **Scalable and Efficient**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for users to receive book recommendations.
- **Streamlit Integration**: Interactive web application built with Streamlit for user interaction.

## Installation
To set up and run the Book Recommendation System on Google Colab, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Google Colab account
- Kaggle account and API key

### Clone the Repository
Open your Google Colab notebook and run the following commands:
```python
!git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Book-Recommendation-System-Using-Collaborative-Based-Filtering.git
%cd Book-Recommendation-System-Using-Collaborative-Based-Filtering
```

### Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:
```python
!pip install streamlit numpy pandas kaggle
```

### Set Up Kaggle API Key
Upload your `kaggle.json` file containing your Kaggle API key to the Colab environment:
```python
from google.colab import files
files.upload()
```

Move the `kaggle.json` file to the correct directory:
```python
!mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
!mv kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
!chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
```

### Download Dataset
Use the Kaggle API to download the dataset:
```python
!kaggle datasets download -d [dataset-name]
!unzip [dataset-name].zip
```

### Create Virtual Environment
```python
!pip install virtualenv
!virtualenv venv
!source venv/bin/activate
```

## Usage
After setting up the environment and installing the dependencies, you can run the Streamlit application using localtunnel for public URL access:
```python
!streamlit run app.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501
```

### Example
Once the system is running, navigate to the provided localtunnel URL to interact with the recommendation system.

## Configuration
Configuration settings for the recommendation system can be found and modified in the `config.py` file. This includes parameters such as the number of recommendations to provide and the algorithm settings.
